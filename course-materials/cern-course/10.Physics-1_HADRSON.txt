TaskM-1

Start VM and open a terminal window
Copy, compile, and build the example into working area
 cd $G4WORKDIR
 mkdir TaskM
 cd TaskM
 cp $G4INSTALL/share/Geant4-10.5.0/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm7 ./
 cd TestEm7
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake -DGeant4_DIR=${G4COMP} ../
 make
Open interactive session
./TestEm7
 /control/execute/vis.mac
 /run/beamOn 1
Check the physics processes attached and their ordering:
/particle/select e-
/particle/processes/dump
Check what particles exist:
/particle/list
Check a particle property:
/particle/select e-
/particle/property/dump
Please type “help” to get the full set of commands for particle category

TaskM-2

Start VM and open a terminal window
